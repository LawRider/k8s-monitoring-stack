Step 1: Prepare Kubernetes Cluster
Ensure you have a properly installed and configured Kubernetes cluster. Utilize tools like kops, kubespray, or others for deploying and managing the cluster.

Step 2: Deploy OpenTelemetry
Use Helm to deploy the OpenTelemetry operator in your cluster:

```bash
helm repo add otel https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts
helm install otel-operator otel/opentelemetry-operator
```
Configure OpenTelemetry resources and exporters for your project, adding necessary annotations and settings for your metrics.

Step 3: Deploy Fluentbit
Use Helm to deploy Fluentbit on each node in the cluster:

```bash
helm repo add fluent https://fluent.github.io/helm-charts
helm install fluent-bit fluent/fluent-bit
```
Configure Fluentbit to collect and export logs from your project and cluster nodes. Utilize configuration files to set up log output.

Step 4: Instrument Project for Metric Export
Use the OpenTelemetry SDK to instrument your project's code and generate metrics.

Ensure proper annotation and labeling for the metrics you wish to collect and verify that they are added to the exported metrics.

Step 5: Deploy Prometheus
Use Helm or Kubernetes configuration files to deploy Prometheus in your cluster:

```bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
```
Configure Prometheus to monitor metrics from your project by adding the relevant jobs and metrics to the configuration.

Step 6: Deploy Grafana Loki
Use Helm to deploy Grafana Loki in the cluster:

```bash
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
helm install loki grafana/loki-stack
```
Configure Fluentbit to send logs to Loki and ensure Loki is configured to store these logs.

Step 7: Deploy Grafana
Use Helm to deploy Grafana in the cluster:

```bash
helm install grafana grafana/grafana
```
Configure connections to Prometheus and Loki in Grafana using the URLs and ports where these components were deployed.

Step 8: Verification and Tuning
Verify that all components are working using the monitoring interfaces of each component (e.g., Prometheus UI, Grafana UI).

Create and configure alerts to be notified of potential issues in the system.

Step 9: Automation and Configuration Management
Use Flux or other tools for automating deployment and updating configurations in the monitoring stack.

Step 10: Scaling and Optimization
Monitor resource usage and optimize component configurations to meet the needs of your project. Consider horizontal scaling or configuration changes to enhance performance.
